        <h1>Hi love! Happy 1st monthsary!</h1>
        <p><b>As we celebrate our first month together, I want to express just how much you mean to me. Every day with you has been a joy, and I cannot imagine my life without you. You have brought so much love, happiness, and joy into my life, and I am grateful for every moment we spend together.</p></b>


<p><b>I am happy that i met you yuan, sa lahat na guys ive talked and dated to, you stood up to me. yes i admit that i am a lalakero in the past because im so desperate to have a boyfriend, and i thought all of guys are redflag and manloloko because of my tragic heartbreak. but since naging tayo, you changed me. you change everything to me. I stopped everything for you, i loved you, i cared for you, i hope you notice that. throughout sa 1st month natin, i cannot expect dadating tayo sa time nato, maabot natin yung 1st month. 
throughout sa up and downs natin that god threw us in this relationship, like we do argue, tampuhan, we are still together. i know we arde too young for this, but i hope god guide us in our love story. you know when i have problems and i need someone to lean on, you were there. and of all people i lean on, being with you is the best treatment.</p></b>
 
<p><b>you've been so kind, caring, and understanding to me and you have shown me what true love really is. I know that no matter what the future holds, and ano mangyayare saatin in the future, I will always have you by my side. i hope you will never fell out of love to me, i hope you will never change.

Even though it's only been a month, it feels like we've been together for a lifetime. Our bond is strong and true, and I know that we will always be here for each other, through thick and thin. You have shown me that true love is real, and I am so grateful to have you in my life.</p></b>


<p><b>I promise to always be by your side, to support you and love you unconditionally. You are my world, my everything, and I cannot wait to spend many more months, years, and lifetimes with you.</p></b>


<p><b>With all my love, your safe sky.</p></b>
